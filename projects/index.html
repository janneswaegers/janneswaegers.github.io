	<h1>Janne Swaegers</h1>
  <p>I mainly do research along the following topics and questions:</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p></p>
  <h2>Evolutionary consequences of range expansion</h2>
	<p>How do populations evolve through the process of range expansion?</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p></p>
  <h2>Range expansion and hybridization</h2>
	<p>What are the factors that lead to heterogeneity in genomic divergence between hybridizing species?</p>
  <p>To what extent is adaptive introgression aiding thermal adaptation in range expanding species?</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p></p>
  <h2>Thermal plasticity and adaptation</h2>
	<p>How does the interplay between evolution and phenotypic plasticity shape responses to global warming?</p>
