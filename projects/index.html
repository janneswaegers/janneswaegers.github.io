	<h1>Janne Swaegers</h1>
  <p>I mainly do research along the following topics and questions:</p>
	<p></p>
  <h2>Evolutionary consequences of range expansion</h2>
	<p>How do populations evolve through the process of range expansion?</p>
	<p></p>
  <h2>Range expansion and hybridization</h2>
	<p>What are the factors that lead to heterogeneity in genomic divergence between hybridizing species?</p>
  <p>To what extent is adaptive introgression aiding thermal adaptation in range expanding species?</p>
	<p></p>
  <h2>Thermal plasticity and adaptation</h2>
	<p>To what extent are responses to global warming a consequence of the result of an interplay between evolution and phenotypic plasticity?</p>
