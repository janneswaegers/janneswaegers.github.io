	<h1>Janne Swaegers</h1>
	<p>Postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://bio.kuleuven.be/eeb/esee">Laboratory of Evolutionary Stress Ecology and Ecotoxicology</a>, KU Leuven, Belgium</p>
	<p>I am interested in disentangling the evolutionary processes driving population differentiation and speciation using genomics and transcriptomics.</p>
	<p>During and after my PhD at the University of Leuven (Belgium) I studied the evolutionary processes during range expansion and thermal adaptation in two damselfly species. After that I went to the Free University of Berlin with an Alexander Von Humboldt Research Fellowship to explore RNA interference possibilities in odonates in (semi)natural conditions.  During my subsequent Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship at Lund University I investigated the factors that lead to genomic divergence between closely related and hybridizing damselfly species of the Ischnura genus. At the moment I am back at the University of Leuven with an FWO Postdoctoral Fellowship to study patterns in gene expression reaction norms during thermal adaptation in a damselfly. </p>
